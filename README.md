# Hangman Game with OpenAI and Socket.IO
## Overview
This is a simple, interactive hangman game that uses the OpenAI API to generate phrases for the user to guess. The game is served over an Express server and uses Socket.IO for real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication.

The game can be played directly in the browser. The user guesses the letters or the entire phrase, and the game provides real-time feedback about the guesses.

## Features
-Random phrase generation for each new game using GPT-3

-Dynamic interface that updates the game status in real-time

-Single letter or complete phrase guessing

-Indication of game status and end of game

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies.

`git clone https://github.com/castey/hangmanGPT.git`

`cd hangmanGPT`

`npm install`

Create a .env file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key.

`API_KEY=your_openai_api_key`

## Usage
To start the server, run:

`npm start`
The server runs on port 3000 by default (or any port specified in your environment variables). You can then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to start playing the game.

You can start a new game or make a guess by typing into the input field and pressing Enter or clicking on the Submit Guess/New Game button. If the input field is empty and you press Enter or click the button, a new game will start. If you've typed something into the field, it will be submitted as a guess.

## Game Rules

A new game can be started at any time
